<h1> Siege Playstyle </h1>
<center> In siege there are 2 teams that switch between attack and defend every round. There is the blue team and the orange team. There are 3 types of gamemodes, secure the objective, bomb, and the hostage. In all gamemodes if all players on one team dies, then they lose. </center>
<h1> Secure the Objective </h1>
<center><img src="images-1.jpeg" height="300"></center>
<center>In secure the objective, the objective is a room that the attacking team has to secure the objective by staying inside the objective. Defenders can prevent attackers from securing the objective by staying inside the objective. When both an attacker and a defender are in the objective, it will become contested which means the progress bar for securing the objective will not move. </center>
<h1> Hostage </h1>
<center><img src="maxresdefault.jpg" height="300"></center>
<center>For hostage, the attacking team has to break into the room that the hostage is in, grab the hostage, and make it to outside of the building to one of the many flares. If either team kills the hostage, the team that killed the hostage loses the round. 
<h1> Bomb </h1>
<img src="images.jpeg" height="300">
<center>For bomb, there are 2 bomb sites. One site is bomb A and the other site is bomb B. The attackers have to get into range of one of the bombs and place a defuser. Once the defuser is placed, then the defenders have to try to destroy the defuser by hitting it with their guns. The defuser cannot be destroyed by grenades or bullets. </center>
<h1> Attackers </h1>
<center><img src="Hibana.jpg"></center>
<p> On the attacking team, the goal is to either completely eliminate the enemy team, secure the objective, defuse the bomb, or secure the hostage. The composition of your team matters while playing on the attacking side. What this means is that certain operators are always needed, such as Hibana and Thermite who can break through reinforced walls and Thatcher that can remove all electronics that would be blocking the Hibana X-KAIROS and Thermite Exothermic Charges from blowing through the wall. There are many other combinations of attacking operators that work well together.
<h1> Defenders </h1>

<p> On the defending team, the goal is to either completely eliminate the enemy team or prevent the attackers from taking objectives until the time runs out. The composition of your team also matters while playing on the defending side. For example Mute and Jäger can prevent Hibana and Thermite from breaking through reinforced walls, prevent Fuze from activating his Cluster Charge and shooting many bombs into targeted rooms. 
<h1> Roaming </h1>
<center><img src="Caveira.jpg"></center>
<p> Roaming in Rainbow Six Siege is the act of leaving the objective while on the defending team and walking around trying to slow the attacking team down while getting a few kills. As a roamer, the only goal is to slow the attacking team as much as possible and possibly get 1 or 2 kills. One of the most notorious romers is Caveira, also known as Cav. Caveira is so well known because of her ability "Silent Step" and "Interrogation" because silent step allows her to move without making any noise and interrogation allows her to approach a downed enemy and "interrogate" them by pressing F. When Caveira interrogates an enemy, she kills them and Caveira's whole team gets real time locations of where all of the enemy team is.
<h1> Lurking </h1>
<center><img src="Kapkan.jpg"></center>
<p> Despite the common belief that roaming is the samething as lurking, it is not. Lurking is taking a position where the enemy team would not expect you to be in. Then when the enemy team passes by, the lurker would get a late flank. This is much different than roaming because one is actively hunting the enemy team, while lurking is staying in one spot until the enemy passes by so that the lurker gets a late flank. One of the most popular roamers is Kapkan. Kapkan is such a popular lurker because he can place his "Entry Denial Devices" to guard the objective while Kapkan is doing his late flank. His "Entry Denial Device" is a small explosive placed on door and have a red laser that goes across. When someone steps over the red laser, it triggers the trap and causes a small explosion killing the player that stepped on it.
<h1> Preparation Phase </h1>
<center><img src="DroneDesign.png" height="400"></center>
<p> For preparation phase, the defending team must reinforce walls and place equipment down in order to prepare for the attacking team to attack the objective. The defending team also has to try to destroy all drones to prevent the attacking team from getting to much information. For the attacking team, during preparation phase their goal is to use drones to find the objective location and ID has many enemy operators as possible while getting their drone into a position where they can get information.
